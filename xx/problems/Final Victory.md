# Final Victory!

With the search space being pushed to be diverse and no absolute score their is no way to determine what the best solutions is.

## Ideas

At the end of the runtime switch to evaluation mode. In evaluation mode searching finishes.

In evaluation mode there are no more children or mutations. Defeated, passive members are eliminated and not replaced. The lower limit on number of survivors is removed.

We keep track of members as they are eliminated and keep a copy of their elimnation order.

When we reduce the sim to one member we have a list of fit members.
