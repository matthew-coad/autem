# WD1 - Wide Data study

The most intractable data sets in the Autem 100 project are wide datasets, typically with hundreds of features.

These datasets frequently lock up, or take excessively long periods of time to process.

The objective of this study is to investigate techniques that can be used to process these datasets.

## Setup Study

Switch to WD1. Set target datasets to run.
