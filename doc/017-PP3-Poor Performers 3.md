# Poor Performers 3

In this study we try to improve the performance of problems that aren't
up to scratch to determine if the current set of algorithms can
solve them.

## PP3 - Cylinder Bands

Cylinder Bands is worst performer

Action - Try svm, short mastery.
Outcome - Target achieved

## PP3 - Try quick block

For:

Australian

Try setting up specific configurations. In general they need the short mastery.

## PP3 - Try bayes with wide problems

Try the bayes hyperlearner with some of the wide problems

outcome - Not a good peformer

## mfeat-zernike

Being a bugger. Tried with a variety of algors

## Final poor performers

Try master with all remaining hard cases using svm, trees, linear and bayes.

## Final wide performers

Also tried some of the wide
