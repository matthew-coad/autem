# Light Configuration

Validate/test the light configuration

The light configuation is a general/reasonably fast configuration that we expect to get good results for a wide varieity of
data sets. Once we've determined which datasets fail we can design different configurations for those datasets.

## LC1 - Run List Configuration

Action - Try all datasets, identifying which ones fail or give poor results.
