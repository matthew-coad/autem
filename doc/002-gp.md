# Gaussian processes

Use gaussian processes to find search space to explore.

Option 1. Finding unexplored space. Areas of search space with high unknowns are target for exploration
Option 2. Zooming in. Exploring areas with high performance. Currently the task of the evol algorithm.

## Exploration

Need to be able to visualize hyper-parameter space.

Components.

**done**

Which components have been tested.
2 dimensional cross cutting of components with a heat map.
Component performance. Variation. Ultimately unknowwns.

**done**

## Expected component score model

Add component that construct a GP model every epoch. Determines score and score sd for component combinations. Set initial asssessments  so totally unknown
combos come up as the highest score + score_sd. Record score + score_sd.

### Add graveyard

Copy finished components to a simulation graveyard

**done**

### Faulty members are final

Mark failed members as final

**done**

### Build score model on new epochs

**done**

### Evaluate expected scores

**done**

## Visualize expected scores
