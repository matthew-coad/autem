# Stability Contest

Some datasets are hard to improve. Typically that have a high variance in their scores and tend to overfit.

Lets assume that good solutions have a low variance and setup a contest that selects members with the lowest standard deviation.

Appropiate data is already collected. We have baseline/score assessments available.
