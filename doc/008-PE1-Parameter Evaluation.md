# PE1 - Parameter Evaluation

Using gausian processors to try to estimate hyper-parameter performance

## PE1 - Introduce Parameter Evaluation

Outcome - Predictive accuracy doesn't seem useful.
Outcome - Some components have defaults that are of a completely different type or not part of a choices range

**done**

## PE1 - Count model contributes

Action - Report on the number of members that contributed to the parameter models evaluation
Justification - So we can select targets for parameter tuning
Outcome - Done

## PE2 - Use parameter optimization only during tuning

## PE2 - Restrict input models to those with valid choices
