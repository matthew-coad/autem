# MS2 - Mastery Study 2

Improvements in design now allowed a workflow closer to the Machine Learning Mastery workflow.

We can set up a workflow that performs the spotchecking for a number of epochs, then switches to
tuning.

Ultimately we want a better design for switching components on and off but right now we'll try to
set something up quickly.

# MS2 - Upgrade tuning state to a setting

Upgrage tuning state to a setting

# MS2 - Reintroduce mastery workflow

Reintroduce mastery settings, upgrading to the latest design

# MS2 - Run each dataset in seperate proceiss

Run each dataset in its own process to manage the thread leaking issue,
manage memory etc.

# MS2 - Run mastery benchmark

Run mastery benchmark on the baseline learner to compare with spotchecks.
