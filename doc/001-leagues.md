Tracking events is a bit of a mess. We want to move things so events are recorded on members then
the system has to respond to the state of members.

Evaluates are now responsible for getting members to match their status.
We now perform 5 fold cross validation for every promotion rather than on every request.

## Evaluate all members every step
