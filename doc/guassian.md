# Gaussian processes

Use gaussian processes to find search space to explore.

Option 1. Finding unexplored space. Areas of search space with high unknowns are target for exploration
Option 2. Zooming in. Exploring areas with high performance. Currently the task of the evol algorithm.

## Exploration

Need to be able to visualize hyper-parameter space.

Components.

**Done**

Which components have been tested.
2 dimensional cross cutting of components with a heat map.
Component performance. Variation. Ultimately unknowwns.

Step 2 parameters.
