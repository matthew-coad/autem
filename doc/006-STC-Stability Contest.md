# STC - Stability Contest

Some datasets are hard to improve. Typically that have a high variance in their scores and tend to overfit.

Lets assume that good solutions have a low variance and setup a contest that selects members with the lowest standard deviation.

Appropiate data is already collected. We have baseline/score assessments available.

## Port score evaluation

## Port Choice Score Prediction

Port choice score prediction component to use evaluation objects. **done**

## Introduce Stability Contest

Action - Add stability contest component. **done**

## STC - Study targeted datasets

Action - Run a study against datasets with poor stability **done**

Outcome - Balance scale went to 100% progress but other datasets got stuck in local minima
where the score victories were balanced by the stability victories.
