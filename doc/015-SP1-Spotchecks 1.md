# Spotchecks 1 Study

Spotchecking is the attempt to find useful modelling pipelines.

When spotchecking we search for good performing models without attempting to tune the hyper-parameters.

This should give us an idea on where to focus the search and eventually build automated workflows that search the problem space.

Also we will move settings into the new hiearcharcial settings model and refine workflows.

## Preparation

## SP1-Move study to SP1

Action-Move study to SN1 **done**

## SP1-Introduce Simulation Settings

Simulation settings things like max_reincarnations, max_time, max_population etc. that generally control the sim.

Its are core concern so leave it in the root.

## SP1-Introduce Spotcheck workflow

The spotcheck workflow uses just the spotchecking tuners to
quickly find which decisions are effective.

Also decision scores should match the scores.

## SP1 - Complete move to settings

Move settings to new hierachical system

## SP1-Seperate learner from configuration in benchmarks

Have learner config seperate
