# Diversity Overwhelmed

Where some models have a high variation in their solution space they can get wiped out by learners
with low variation in their solution space.

E.G. in the Boston quick spot the knn which had a k tuning parameter and requires standardization
can easily get wiped by the simplified models the well performing variations get tested.
